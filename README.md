## ⚠️ Known Limitations vs. Arduino Pro Micro

While this board is highly compatible, there are a few important differences:

1. **Analog Inputs**  
   - Only **A0 to A3** are available (4 total)  
   - Other analog pins present on the Pro Micro are not supported  

2. **5V Output (Pin 21)**  
   - On the Arduino Pro Micro, Pin 21 outputs **5V**  
   - On this board, Pin 21 outputs **3.3V**  

3. **MAX7219 & 5V Requirement**  
   - The MAX7219 driver must still be powered with **5V**  
   - Therefore, an **external 5V source** is required, or you can use **Pin 24 (Vin)**, which provides 5V directly from the USB connector  

4. **Level Shifting for MAX7219**  
   - The MAX7219 requires **5V logic levels**  
   - Use a **level shifter** between the PicoMicro board (3.3V signals) and the MAX7219 inputs  

5. **Bootloader Button**  
   - The board includes a **dedicated BOOT button** to enter USB mass storage boot mode (for firmware flashing).

## 🔧 Example Wiring (MAX7219 with External 5V)

When using a MAX7219 with this PicoMicro board, note the following:

- The MAX7219 **requires 5V power** for reliable operation.
- The PicoMicro board only provides **3.3V logic**, so a **level shifter** is required on the SPI signals.
- Use the `Vin` pin (Pin 24, USB 5V) as the 5V source if no external supply is available.
- Do **not** use Pin 21 (`5V`), as it only provides 3.3V on this board.

#### Wiring Notes

- **Vin (5V USB)** → **VCC (5V MAX7219)**
- **GND** → **GND**
- **MOSI (3.3V)** → (via level shifter) → **DIN (5V)**
- **SCK (3.3V)** → (via level shifter) → **CLK (5V)**
- **CS (3.3V)** → (via level shifter) → **LOAD/CS (5V)**

Make sure to add a **3.3V → 5V level shifter** on the SPI signals to the MAX7219.

## 🖥 Advantages for Mobiflight Community Devices

Many Mobiflight **Custom Devices** (Community Devices) are more complex and require more memory and processing power than the classic Arduino Pro Micro can provide.  
This board with the **RP2350A** offers clear advantages:

- **More Flash** → room for larger device code and libraries.  
- **More RAM** → essential for OLED displays and complex buffers.  
- **Higher performance** → smoother updates and faster response.  
- **Dual-Core CPU** → allows splitting tasks (e.g., handling displays and inputs in parallel).  
- **PIO offload** → precise timing for LEDs, drivers, or custom protocols  

This makes the PicoMicro board especially well-suited for **community-driven Mobiflight devices**, including setups with **OLED displays** and other resource-demanding modules.

## ✈️ Why It Matters for Mobiflight
- **Supports more devices per board** → fewer boards, fewer USB connections
- **Fast response times** → smoother input/output handling with no lag
- **Drop-in compatibility** → works in place of the Pro Micro in your cockpit modules  
- **Future-ready** → while the ATmega32U4 reaches its limits, the PicoMicro provides plenty of headroom for upcoming Mobiflight features
