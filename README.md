# RP2040 ProMicro-Compatible Board

This board retains the familiar Arduino Pro Micro form factor and pinout but replaces the aging ATmega32U4 microcontroller with the modern **Raspberry Pi RP2040**.

The result: massively improved performance, more memory, richer interfaces, and greater development flexibility â€” without changing your mechanical or PCB design.

## ðŸš€ Key Advantages

### 1. Significantly Higher Processing Power
- **RP2040:** Dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ running at **133 MHz** (overclockable beyond 200 MHz)  
- **ATmega32U4:** 8-bit AVR at **16 MHz**  
**Benefit:** Faster execution of complex code, smoother multitasking, and real-time data handling.

### 2. Vastly Increased Memory
| Feature | RP2040 | ATmega32U4 |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Flash   | 2 MB   | 32 KB      |
| SRAM    | 264 KB | 2.5 KB     |
**Benefit:** Supports larger programs, bigger buffers, and more complex libraries without memory constraints.

### 3. Modern Connectivity
- **Native USB 1.1 Full Speed** supporting HID, CDC, Mass Storage, and more  
- **PIO (Programmable I/O):** Custom, high-speed protocol support in hardware  
- Multiple **SPI**, **IÂ²C**, and **UART** interfaces, usable in parallel  
**Benefit:** Greater flexibility for multi-device projects

### 4. Energy Efficiency
- Low-power modes for battery operation  
- Direct 3.3 V logic compatibility â€” no level shifters needed for modern peripherals

### 5. Flexible Software Support
- Works with **Arduino IDE**, **MicroPython**, **CircuitPython**, and native **C/C++ SDK**  
**Benefit:** Suitable for both traditional Arduino workflows and modern Python-based rapid prototyping

### 6. Future-Proof
- RP2040 is current, actively supported, and part of a large ecosystem  
- ATmega32U4 is over a decade old and limited for modern applications
